**Helping You Design Better Microsoft Fabric Solutions – Together**

Welcome to the Microsoft Fabric Architecture Guide – a community-driven initiative dedicated to supporting data architects, developers, and decision-makers in designing robust, scalable, and future-ready solutions on Microsoft Fabric.

Whether you're just getting started or already building complex data platforms, this guide aims to provide **clarity, structure, and best practices** for crafting effective architectures using the full capabilities of Microsoft Fabric.

## 🎯 Purpose

This guide is designed to:

- Provide opinionated but practical guidance on how to architect Microsoft Fabric environments
- Cover key design areas including data ingestion, transformation, governance, AI integration, and cost optimization
- Share real-world architectural patterns, use cases, and lessons learned
- Encourage open contributions and community collaboration

## 🚧 Work in Progress

We’re currently in the early stages of building the guide. Over the coming weeks, you'll see the first sections take shape – starting with foundational concepts and evolving into detailed architectural patterns, decision trees, and deployment strategies.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

Everyone is welcome to contribute – whether you're a Fabric expert, a curious learner, or someone who's figured out a smart solution worth sharing. We believe the best guidance comes from real-world experience, and this guide will only thrive through community input.

Contribution guidelines and a roadmap will follow soon.

Let’s build the future of Fabric architecture – together.
